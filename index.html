        <h2>“Shake It Off”—Taylor Swift.</h2>
        <p>I stay out too late<br>
            Got nothin' in my brain<br>
            That's what people say, mm-mm<br>
            That's what people say, mm-mm<br>
            I go on too many dates (Haha)<br>
            But I can't make them stay<br>
            At least, that's what people say, mm-mm<br>
            That's what people say, mm-mm<br>
            But I keep cruisin'<br>
            Can't stop, won't stop movin'<br>
            It's like I got this music in my mind<br>
            Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play<br>
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate<br>
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake <br> 
I shake it off, I shake it off<br>
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break<br>
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake<br>
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake<br>
I shake it off, I shake it off<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I never miss a beat<br>
            I'm lightnin' on my feet<br>
            And that's what they don't see, mm-mm<br>
            That's what they don't see, mm-mm<br>
            I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)<br>
            I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)<br>
            And that's what they don't know, mm-mm<br>
            That's what they don't know, mm-mm<br>
            But I keep cruisin'<br>
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'<br>
It's like I got this music in my mind<br>
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright<br>
            
        </p>

        <p>
            'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play<br>
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate<br>
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake<br>
I shake it off, I shake it off<br>
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break<br>
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake<br>
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake<br>
I shake it off, I shake it off<br>
        </p>

            I shake it off, I shake it off<br>
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off<br>
